# Note Taking App

Welcome to the Note Taking App, a versatile and secure web-based application for all your note-taking needs. This app is designed to support drawing on various devices including the iPad with an Apple Pencil and PCs using a mouse.

## Features

### Drawing Tools
1. **Pencil with Color Options**: Select from a variety of colors to create notes that are vibrant and personalized.
2. **Eraser**: Easily correct mistakes or remove unwanted marks from your notes.

### Canvas Management
1. **Save the Canvas**: Save your work locally to ensure your notes are stored securely on your device.
2. **Load the Canvas**: Load previously saved notes to continue your work or review past drawings.

### Technology
- **SVG Libraries**: We utilize SVG libraries for drawing to provide crisp, scalable vector graphics instead of the traditional HTML5 raster canvas. This ensures your drawings maintain high quality at any zoom level.
